//This file is used to render the settings form for the admin settings page.
//We can also use settings section (with empty heading) inside the tab_1() or tab_2() method to render arbitrary HTML code. 
//Search the code with 'swpm-documentation' to see an example of this.
//However, you can't add your own forms in there since it will be wrapped by the main settings form (so it will be a form inside a form situation).
//You can create links to use GET query arguments.
